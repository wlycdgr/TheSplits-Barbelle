* add menu scroll sound effect
* add menu select sound effect
* add slide in / slide out sound effect(s)

* consider the design of the game. what does it need. what is good about it. what is not so good.
it feels good to move the piece around
i feel depressed and eager to quit working on this immediately
it feels good to move it all around and stuff and i don't want to do this
god i hate this
why am i doing this
who cares
literally no one cares
no one will play this
no one will buy this
i will hate it myself
why am i doing this
just arrogance or some kind of insecurity

no one has encouraged me for years
no one has given a shit for years
even my fucking girlfriend does not care about this or encourage me or support me in this

whatever, just gotta do it, gotta make it good you know
